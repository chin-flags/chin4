Not long ago, I wondered why an air compressor was making weird noises and not working, then suddenly started working once I pressed a random button in the panel.

Now I'm trying to figure out why my button changes color to green when I click it, even though I didn't code it that way!

This has been a fun-filled satisfying journey from being a mechanical engineer in the medical gas industry to the world of software development.

## The Beginning

I can start by saying I am not that passionate about software development. That does not mean that I don't like coding and someone else is forcing me to code (with a gun pointing to my head). Passion follows skill. By focusing on developing skills and taking new opportunities, one can create a more fulfilling work life.

## First Steps into Programming

The first coding task I did was for a solar energy system back in my university for a project. As you might already know, the sun rises from the east and goes down in the west, at least in my country, Sri Lanka. Solar panels work at maximum efficiency when sun rays are perpendicular to the panel. Our project idea was to have a set of solar panels follow the sun's path - a set of rotating solar panels!

The program was written in assembly first and ran in a microcontroller as there were no cool and easy gadgets like Raspberry Pi in those days. (Ok, I used the words "those days" - I feel old now!) The program decided which direction the panel system should rotate and gave a signal to a motor to do so. Then we realized that the human brain has not evolved for assembly, so we started using C language.

During the final presentation, someone in the audience asked about the specification of the motor we used to rotate the solar panels. Turns out that motor just casually consumed all the energy that we took so much effort to improve by rotating the panels. I just said we didn't have the funding for a more power-efficient servo motor and that this project would be very practical in the future - except it wasn't. We installed a few solar panels on our home roof, and they don't rotate!

## Academic Journey

I started following a bachelor's degree in IT on the side. Turns out it's not a good idea for me to get overwhelmed by both gear wheels and for loops, even though they both involve rotations.

I did 2 internships - one at a glove manufacturing factory and another at a biscuit factory during the degree program. After graduation, I joined an apparel company for 10 months, got bored, and joined a natural gas company. I was involved mostly in project management of medical gas pipeline systems (MGPS) and some industrial projects that involved gases, such as beverages, cryogenic freezing, tire manufacturing, etc.

## Medical Gas Engineering Experience

At first, my experience was very rewarding. Sri Lanka being a country with "free" healthcare (in quotes because nothing is free in this world), I could see the impact I made once a project I undertook was commissioned. We installed medical gas systems in existing units such as ICU, operating theaters, etc., making hospital staff's lives easier and saving more patient lives as well. This was more important during the COVID era because there are very few engineers with expertise in medical gas installation in the country. So it was more of a national duty.

At the same time, my role was a huge burden because I was dealing with the lives of many people. A bug in an app could result in some financial loss or other resource issues. But with medical engineering, it's lives. I have had emergency calls in the middle of the night from a major maternity hospital saying there was an alarm in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit for newborns) indicating that oxygen pressure for the whole unit was reaching a very risky level. On another occasion, there was an electrical fire in an ICU about 100km away from my home. There was even a case that generated breaking news on 1-2 live TV channels!

## Building Digital Solutions

While at the job, I started experimenting with a digital solution to solve an issue we had. In case I forget to mention this at the end of the post as advice for new folks getting into dev, here it is: "try to scratch your own itch by solving some issue/pain you face in your life and build a digital solution." And that's what I did too.

Our pain was properly handling customer complaints about breakdowns. Some customers just call customer service, some call the engineering department directly. Some government hospitals send a fax and letter by post as they are required to follow a protocol. The pain was actually organizing those complaints, tracking them, and keeping statuses of each. We had a SAP module to handle this, but it wasn't flexible enough for our use case.

I started building our own solution - a mobile app with React Native for customer service to collect information on breakdowns, attach photos, etc., and for us engineers to prioritize and take the required actions. I could convince the management team to use this internally, and it went well for 2 years until I left the company.

## First Freelance Opportunity

During the initial few months of the COVID era, just before my country imposed lockdown, I met Guillaume. He was looking for a freelancer for a SaaS that he and some other folks were building. That was my very first paid gig in dev. As my interview task, I was given the task to build a calculator without using any libraries. I think I did a good job there. During the interview, my microphone didn't work, so we started chatting with sign language, and I knew how to signal money and numbers with fingers.

He hired me anyway!

Life has been pretty good ever since. I've been doing some coding ever since - mostly full stack, some AI, some web3.

Now I work as a DevRel Engineer for MetaMask, focusing mostly on the Delegation Toolkit.

## What I Carried from Mechanical Engineering to Dev

Some technical stuff. Even though mechanical systems and code look different at a glance, there are some similarities too, at least it feels like so.

Say a leak in the compressor system - when pressure drops in the pipeline without any consumption, we suspect there is a leak. So we would try to isolate the components in the whole system rather than focusing on the whole thing. This systematic debugging approach translates well to software development.

## What Could I Have Done Better

Not much, really.

## Tips, Tricks, and Bad Ideas

It's not very easy to change careers midway. You already have educational and professional qualifications in the field, you've built a network around that, and of course, you might be pretty comfortable. So why do you want to shift? For some, it's the "passion"; for some, it's the money and opportunities. For whatever reason, you actually need to take action, which involves learning and building a portfolio. Because you have to prove that you know how to code. Often times we don't take this action unless we are forced to do it. Your calendar is already full with work and family commitments, so how could you find some focused time to sit and code?

Willpower gets you up to some extent, but it's consistency that leads you forward. For me, what happened was I ran out of options.

One major difference between tech and typical mechanical engineering is the speed of innovation. If you somehow stay away for even a year and decide to come back again, you might find yourself behind.

My previous job? Not really - I could even join the same role today after leaving 5 years ago and start without much of an issue. So you'll be learning continuously to stay relevant, mostly on your own - reading documentation, trying out examples, etc. And guess what? Self-taught folks have been doing it since the beginning.

Degree? That's tricky. A degree is helpful, of course, and self-taught developers have a disadvantage here.

## What's Next

I don't know, really.

I don't believe in long-term goals. Life is about evolution.

We could have a vision of how our life might look like, but our lives are just random events that occur to us. Somehow one thing leads to other things, and things go on. But we can make sense of everything in the end. Steve Jobs put it perfectly in his Stanford commencement speech: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."
